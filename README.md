🧠 Project Overview: Credit Card Data Analysis
📌 Objective:
The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of customer data from a credit card company to understand user behavior, identify key financial patterns, and prepare the data for potential applications like fraud detection, credit approval, or risk assessment using labeled outcomes.

🔍 Why This Project?
In today's digital economy, credit card usage is nearly universal. Banks and financial institutions collect massive volumes of user data — including income, employment history, family status, and repayment behavior. Analyzing this data helps:

Improve customer segmentation

Detect risky applicants or fraudulent activity

Build credit scoring or recommendation systems

Optimize marketing strategies

🧑‍💻 My Contribution:
In this project, I contributed to:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning null values, merging datasets, and preparing features for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing distributions of income, gender, education, car/property ownership, and correlations.

Feature Insights: Identifying important demographic and financial trends using countplots, violin plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Label Interpretation: Converting target variables into human-readable classes (yes/no) for better clarity in classification tasks.

📈 Skills & Tools Used:
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Data Cleaning: Null handling, merging multiple CSVs

Visualization: EDA using bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, pie charts and powerBi

Label Engineering: Binary classification mapping

Jupyter Notebook: Structured analysis and interactive exploration

💡 Future Scope:
This dataset can further be used for:

Building predictive models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests)

Applying feature selection techniques

Testing anomaly detection algorithms (for fraud)

Deployment as a credit risk evaluation tool
